<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This project focuses on developing a sustainable redesign proposal for Portland State University’s Smith Memorial Student Union (SMSU). The goal was to enhance energy efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and improve community engagement in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The proposal centers on implementing environmentally responsible infrastructure upgrades and inclusive space improvements for students and stakeholders.

<h2>Scope and Deliverables</h2>

This project included the development of core project management components such as a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), project schedule, network diagram, cost estimation, resource allocation, and a comprehensive risk management plan. Each deliverable was designed to structure project execution effectively and support a realistic, sustainable building improvement strategy.

<h2>Budget and Timeline</h2>

The proposal used a projected budget of $24,000 and a schedule spanning March 1 to June 30, 2025, accounting for approximately 500 labor hours. Cost planning included both labor and non-labor expenses to ensure accountability and alignment with institutional goals.

<h2>Project Controls and Execution</h2>

Project control measures included weekly tracking of milestones, budget monitoring, and risk reviews. Tools such as Trello and Smartsheet were used to manage dependencies, tasks, and communications. A formal termination and post-implementation review plan was also created to support structured project closure and continuous improvement.

<h2>Outcome</h2>

This project demonstrates the application of professional project management methodologies — including planning, scheduling, budgeting, risk evaluation, and stakeholder coordination — to deliver a realistic sustainability initiative for a campus environment.
